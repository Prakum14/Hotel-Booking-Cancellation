# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation
A model training for predicting the hotel booking cancellation to prevent wrong revenue estimation

This project aims to predict hotel booking cancellations using machine learning.

Dataset
The dataset used is the Hotel Booking Demand Dataset. It includes features such as lead time, arrival date, length of stay, number of guests, and booking cancellations.

Model
A neural network model built with Keras is used for this binary classification problem. Neural networks are suitable for this task as they can learn complex patterns in the data to predict cancellations.
